This tutorial provides information on where to find single-cell RNA-seq data, and how to download it for processing with the __kallisto &#124; bustools__ workflow.

__Note:__ for the instructions, command line arguments are preceeded by`$`. For example, if you see `$ cd my_folder` then type `cd my_folder`. 

#### Databases

There are four databases that are important repositories for sequencing data and metadata, and that are relevant for obtaining single-cell RNA-seq data:

- [__European Nucelotide Archive__](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) (ENA):
- [__Gene Expression Omnibus__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO):
- [__Genome Sequence Archive__](http://gsa.big.ac.cn/) (GSA): 
- [__Sequence Read Archive__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (SRA):
